# TidyTuesdays
My playground for R plots and taking part of the #TidyTuesday challenge, a weekly data project in R from the R4DS ("R for Data Science") online learning community. The goal of this project is to explore and develop R skills by making meaningful charts with {ggplot2}, {tidyr}, {dplyr} and other tools that are part of the {tidyverse} ecosystem.

# Lovely little helpful packages/Lessons learned
* hrbrthemes - all time favorite themes for ggplot

* ggtext - individual styles for titles/subtitles/captions or text in general

* patchwork - combine multiple plots to one poster (easiest way)
* gridExtra - combine multiple plots to one poster (workaround for combining plots with and without axes labels)

# Lovely little plots
